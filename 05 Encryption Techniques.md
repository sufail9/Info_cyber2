# Encripted Techniques
## Learning objectives
- Understand cryptography basics  
- Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption  
- Learn hashing and digital signature concepts  

## ðŸ§© Cryptography
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure confidentiality.

## ðŸ”¸ Symmetric Encryption
- Uses one key for both encryption and decryption.  
- Fast, suitable for bulk data encryption.  


## ðŸ”¹ Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses two keys: public key (for encryption) and private key (for decryption).  
- Used for secure key exchange and digital communication.  


## ðŸ”‘ Hashing
- Converts data into a fixed-length string.
- one-way process - cannot be reversed.
- used for password storage and integrity checking.
- common Algorithm: SHA-256, MD5 (deprecated)

## Digital Signatures and Certifications
- Ensure authenticity and non-repudiation.
- A digital signature uses private key to sign data and public key to verify.
- Certificates (X.509) are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) for trust verificationÂ (usedÂ inÂ HTTPS).

## Example:
when visiting https://bank.com
- browser verifies certifcation signed by CA to ensure authenticity.
