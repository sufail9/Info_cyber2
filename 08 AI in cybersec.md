# Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity
## Core Concepts

### Role of AI/ML in Cybersecurity
- Machine Learning for intrusion detection and malware analysis
- Predictive analytics for attack prevention
- AI-driven SOC automation (SOAR tools)

### ΑΙ Techniques in Security
- Supervised learning: Malware classification (Benign vs Malicious)
- Unsupervised learning: Anomaly detection in logs
- Reinforcement learning: Adaptive response systems

### Application of AI in ThreatDetection
- Email phishing detection using NLP
- Behavior-based enddpoint protection  - Network traffic anomaly detection (IDS/IPS enhancement)
- User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

### AI-Powered Tools & Platforms

- IBM QRadar Advisor with Watson
- Darktrace (AI for network anomaly detection)
- CrowdStrike Falcon (AI endpoint protection)
- CylancePROTECT, Azure Sentinel (ML-based alerts)

### Limitations & Ethical Challenges

- Adversarial ML (poisoning data, evasion attacks)
- Privacy concerns (training data exposure)
- Explainability issues (AI decision transparency)
